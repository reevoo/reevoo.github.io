We've found that we keep neglecting projects that have high payoff, but aren't urgent. You know the kinds of things - contributing to open source, building tools for internal use, improving our skills. At companies like [3M](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1663137/how-3m-gave-everyone-days-off-and-created-an-innovation-dynamo), [Atlassian](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/09/innovation-week-20-time-in-a-box/), and [formerly at Google](http://qz.com/115831/googles-20-time-which-brought-you-gmail-and-adsense-is-now-as-good-as-dead/) people have used 15% or 20% time to start projects that have turned into valuable business opportunities such as [Post-it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_note) notes.

So we decided to try it. [Jonny](https://github.com/jonnyarnold) came up with a manifesto:

### We believe...

 * that many important, valuable projects are never the top priority, meaning
   they are never completed.
 * that in our current system there is not enough time for activities such as
   developer education, freedom to innovate and building our public reputation.
 * that the business will benefit from a more innovative, educated and
   motivated engineering team.
 * that developers' enthusiasm for a project is precious and that they can be
   trusted to use their enthusiasm on projects with real business value.

### We propose...

 * that the workload for each sprint should be reduced by 20%.
 * that developers are expected to spend up to 1 day a week to work on their own projects.
 * that developers are expected to complete what they committed to in the
   sprint.
 * that developers are expected to demonstrate in stand-ups and
   retrospectives what they have achieved during their 20% time and record
   their projects on the wiki.
 * that developers are free to choose what to spend their 20% time doing, as
   long as they can demonstrate business value in stand-ups and retrospectives.

### We can measure our success...

 * with our sprint velocity, as we believe more educated and enthusiastic
   developers work faster.
 * with the number of new, innovative projects and the business value that they
   generate.

We'll hold a retrospective in a month to see how it's gone, and we'll blog the
results here.
