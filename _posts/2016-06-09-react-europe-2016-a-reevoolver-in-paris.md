A couple of weeks ago, I attended the [ReactEurope 2016](https://www.react-europe.org/) conference in Paris. It was my first time on an event of this kind, and I was very surprised by the vibe and energy of all the attendants and speakers. Some of the last where authors of libraries that we use at Reevoo or people who I follow in Twitter. It was interesting seeing the RealWorldâ„¢ people instead of their digital counterparts for a change.

# The conference

The conference lasted for two days, June 2nd and 3rd. The structure was quite similar both days: blocks consisting in two half an hour talks followed by 30 minutes break, where you could have some coffee, stretch your legs and talk with people. [Christopher Chedeau](https://twitter.com/Vjeux) (one of the developers who has been involved in React since the beginning) was the one introducing all the speakers and encouraging people to go and talk with each other or with the speakers during the breaks. This was quite related with his talk, which I will talk about later. By the end of both days there was a round of lightning talks, with some interesting surprises.

## Day one

The conference opened with a [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvAXVMwHJXU) from [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov). He is the co-creator of [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) (probably the most popular Flux-like library) and he talked about what happened since he [released it in last year's ReactEurope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs).

The first surprise of the day came from [Christopher Chedeau](https://twitter.com/Vjeux) talking about "Being successful at Open Source" and how they managed to make React popular. He suggested that every developer should have a blog or write about what they do. Share the knowledge, contribute back to the community. Very inspiring.

The biggest highlight was [Cheng Lou](https://twitter.com/_chenglou)'s talk "On the Spectrum of Abstraction". In the weirdest (by far) and coolest talk of the conference, he defined abstraction and the concepts "power" and "usefulness" in terms of programming languages and libraries. It is mind-blowing seeing how he ties everything together and the final pun is priceless. If you are going to watch just one talk, this is it.

It was also interesting seeing Daniel Schafer talking about [how Facebook solves some common problems with GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etax3aEe2dA) and [Jeff Morrison](https://github.com/jeffmo) talking about [Flow internals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEaDsKyDxkY).

By the end of the day there were some lightning talks, where we could see [how you do a demo when your YouTube video fails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It7jU4uKxSk) (minute 2:25), or how [Sebastian McKenzie](https://twitter.com/sebmck) is trying to [make JavaScript initialize faster to improve the React Native experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbZzahWakGs).
