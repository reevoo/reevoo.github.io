At Reevoo we like sharing knowledge, that's why we decided to start a series of weekly workshops. Depending on the week we will be playing with new tools, looking at how a framework works or studying how to architect a project. As a workshop is a session that doesn't make sense to keep repeating, we thought that would be nice to record them and share what we are doing with the world.

Without further ado, I give you the unedited video of "First contact with ES6 and React".

This was the first time that we were recording a workshop, so it might not be as good as it could've been. We'll try to improve and make them more video friendly from now on. I hope you enjoy it and you can learn one thing or two.
