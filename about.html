<h1 id="reevoo-engineering">Reevoo Engineering</h1>

<p>We are engineers, designers and product managers who want to make the best stuff.</p>

<p>How do we work? That changes every day. You could call it agile, if you want to label it.</p>

<p>We ship a few times a day, using AWS, Capistrano, Chef, ...</p>

<p>We use <a href='https://github.com/reevoo'>Github</a> because it's awesome. We use Pull Requests, because we all make mistakes. We write code in the language that fits the problem best. We write Ruby, Javascript, Java, PHP, C#, Go, Rust, Elixir, Clojure, ...</p>

<p>Oh, and we have scooters. Yes, <i>scooters</i>.</p>

<h2>Cian Leahy</h2>

<h4>Chief Stuff Breaker</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://uk.linkedin.com/in/cianleahy'>Cian on LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Cian spends his day gleefully breaking things and annoying developers. He describes his favourite phrase as being, "it worked on my machine". The best day of his life was when Microsoft discontinued support for Internet Explorer 10, 9 and the hateful 8.</p>

<p>His past life included a spell on the dark side as a developer to learn the ways of the enemy. Heâ€™s also run large QA teams for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircom_International'>Aircom</a>, <a href='http://www.nice.com/'>Fizzback and NICE systems</a>. In his spare time, he helps assist with climate change mapping in the (mostly submerged) Deep South of Ireland. He also enjoys teaching the future brats of the English Premier League how to win free kicks by nefarious means and celebrate goals with zero grace.</p>

<h2>Jayson Robinson</h2>

<h4>Medium Data Specialist</h4>

  <li><a href='https://twitter.com/JonnyArnold89'>@JaysonRobinson on Twitter</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Jayson is CMO (Chief Morale Officer) of his side of the room and has been described by his colleagues recently in his appraisals as "sporadically competent". 

<p>Following his childhood dream of moving to the big city from 8 miles out in Bromley, Jayson spent the majority of his "good years" being flogged in <a href='http://www.deloittedigital.com/eu/'>Deloitte Digital</a> as a consultant. He escaped in 2014. He now divides his remaining years equally between aggressively disagreeing with almost everything, helping out around the office with odd jobs where he can, and his various philanthropic endeavours for homeless penguins. Rumour has it he is a product manager, but nobody has ever witnessed this. He can also do some data.</p>

<p>In his spare time Jayson primarily dances, provides lifestyle guidance, and does motivational speaking engagements.</p>

<h2>Jonny Arnold</h2>

<h4>Director of Comedy</h4>

<ul>

  <li><a href='https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonnyarnold'>Jonny on LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Jonny has fiddled with computers since the age of 10, but only got paid for it quite recently. After several years as a consultant, Jonny joined Reevoo as a developer in 2014. Jonny can often be found ranting in a weakly Northern accent about code quality, company culture or <a href='http://agilemanifesto.org/'>The Agile Manifesto</a>.</p>

<p>Oddly, Jonny spends a lot of time programming outside of work as well as attending tech events in London. He is also studying Japanese, playing volleyball and presenting radio shows, although usually not at the same time.</p>

<h2>Mike Moss</h2>

<h4>Dashboard Monkey</h4>

<p>Mike spends more time than is healthy in Tableau making a dashboard for everything under the sun. Having started out in publishing as a market analyst he made a sideways career move into the fun world of data when he realised that numbers are better than words, and the only thing better than numbers are bright colours.</p>

<p>Outside of work, Mike enjoys shouting at rugby matches, either on the television or in person. He does not enjoy writing about himself in the third person because it's weird. His wife is trying to teach him Chinese, but he's not a good student.</p>
