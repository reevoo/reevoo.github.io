<h1 id="reevoo-engineering">Reevoo Engineering</h1>

<p>We are engineers, designers and product managers who want to make the best stuff.</p>

<p>How do we work? That changes every day. You could call it agile, if you want to label it.</p>

<p>We ship a few times a day, using AWS, Capistrano, Chef, ...</p>

<p>We use <a href='https://github.com/reevoo'>Github</a> because it's awesome. We use Pull Requests, because we all make mistakes. We write code in the language that fits the problem best. We write Ruby, Javascript, Java, PHP, C#, Go, Rust, Elixir, Clojure, ...</p>

<p>Oh, and we have scooters. Yes, <i>scooters</i>.</p>

<h1>The Team</h1>

<h2>Alex Malkov</h2>

<h4>Professor Astro Cat</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://uk.linkedin.com/in/alexmalkov'>Alex on LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To answer your questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Because he has a cat.</li>
  <li>Because he holds Master's degree in Physics (coincidentally, in Radio-Astronomy).</li>
  <li>Because Professor just sounds better!</li>
</ol>

<p>On a daily basis, Alex is responsible for the formation and evolution of Reevoo's Solar System within the UGC Galaxy, fighting with the black holes and trying to organise the constellations of Reevoo's apps.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Alex uses the <a href='https://github.com/soundcloud/lhm'>Large Hadron Migrator</a> in his work (no, not that big useless collider thing...) to achieve the team's longer-term technical and architectural goals.</p>

<h2>Cian Leahy</h2>

<h4>Chief Stuff Breaker</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://uk.linkedin.com/in/cianleahy'>Cian on LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Cian spends his day gleefully breaking things and annoying developers. He describes his favourite phrase as being, "it worked on my machine". The best day of his life was when Microsoft discontinued support for Internet Explorer 10, 9 and the hateful 8.</p>

<p>His past life included a spell on the dark side as a developer to learn the ways of the enemy. He's also run large QA teams for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircom_International'>Aircom</a>, <a href='http://www.nice.com/'>Fizzback and NICE systems</a>. In his spare time, he helps assist with climate change mapping in the (mostly submerged) Deep South of Ireland. He also enjoys teaching the future brats of the English Premier League how to win free kicks by nefarious means and celebrate goals with zero grace.</p>

<h2>David Sevcik</h2>

<h4>Chief Beard Officer</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://uk.linkedin.com/in/davidsevcik'>David on LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>

<p>David has been fascinated by computers from his childhood. Fortunately, over the years he has become less nerdy and started meeting human beings, which brought him to the Reevoo star team. His main focus at work is clean software design and architecture.</p>

<p>Outside of work he spends his free time travelling, meeting friends, learning, cycling and working on side projects trying to solve challenges around software effectiveness.</p>

<p>Deepak is too busy to write his own profile, so someone has had to do it for him.</p>

<h4>Token Metalhead</h4>

  <li><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-saunders-75b84a4b'>Ed on LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Ed's been playing with computers since he first started playing <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia'>Prince of Persia</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_II'>Civilisation II</a> back on his parents' cruddy little Amstrad back in the early 90s. This grew into an (un)healthy gaming addiction which allowed him to somehow stumble into coding and a career as a software developer.  Ultimately he lives by credo: "It's a great job and someone's gotta do it, so it might as well be me".</p>

<p>Outside of work he can be found propping up bars, playing with cats, listening to heavy metal, going to gigs and, of course, playing computer games.  And sometimes being chased by balloonicorns.</p>

<h2>Erdem Gezer</h2>

<h4>Head of Daydreaming and Hope</h4>

  <li><a href='https://twitter.com/erdemgezer'>@erdemgezer on Twitter</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Erdem has started his career by building websites using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_HomeSite'>Allaire HomeSite</a> back in the late 90s. While he was doing his Masters in Software Engineering he was also working as a web developer, mainly building stuff on ASP.NET.</p>

<p>After buying his first iPhone, he decided to build mobile apps and worked as an iOS developer for 2-3 years. Finally, Erdem found his true love - Ruby - and joined Reevoo as a developer in the last months of 2015.</p>

<p>He is passionate about generating, prototyping and testing new ideas. This doesn't stop him from also being passionate about good code.</p>

<p>In his spare time Erdem likes watching football, eating good food and travelling.</p>

<h2>Jayson Robinson</h2>

<h4>Medium Data Specialist</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jayson-robinson-8b4a4515'>Jayson on LinkedIn</a></li>
  <li><a href='https://twitter.com/JaysonRobinson'>@JaysonRobinson on Twitter</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Jayson is CMO (Chief Morale Officer) of his side of the room and has been described by his colleagues recently in his appraisals as "sporadically competent". 

<p>Following his childhood dream of moving to the big city from 8 miles out in Bromley, Jayson spent the majority of his "good years" being flogged in <a href='http://www.deloittedigital.com/eu/'>Deloitte Digital</a> as a consultant. He escaped in 2014. He now divides his remaining years equally between aggressively disagreeing with almost everything, helping out around the office with odd jobs where he can, and his various philanthropic endeavours for homeless penguins. Rumour has it he is a product manager, but nobody has ever witnessed this. He can also do some data.</p>

<p>In his spare time Jayson primarily dances, provides lifestyle guidance, and does motivational speaking engagements.</p>

<h2>Jonny Arnold</h2>

<h4>Director of Comedy</h4>

  <li><a href='https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonnyarnold'>Jonny on LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Jonny has fiddled with computers since the age of 10, but only got paid for it quite recently. After several years as a consultant, Jonny joined Reevoo as a developer in 2014. Jonny can often be found ranting in a weakly Northern accent about code quality, company culture or <a href='http://agilemanifesto.org/'>The Agile Manifesto</a>.</p>

<p>Oddly, Jonny spends a lot of time programming outside of work as well as attending tech events in London. He is also studying Japanese, playing volleyball and presenting radio shows, although usually not at the same time.</p>

<h2>Mike Moss</h2>

<h4>Dashboard Monkey</h4>

<p>Mike spends more time than is healthy in Tableau making a dashboard for everything under the sun. Having started out in publishing as a market analyst he made a sideways career move into the fun world of data when he realised that numbers are better than words, and the only thing better than numbers are bright colours.</p>

<p>Outside of work, Mike enjoys shouting at rugby matches, either on the television or in person. He does not enjoy writing about himself in the third person because it's weird. His wife is trying to teach him Chinese, but he's not a good student.</p>

<h2>Mitch Nicholson</h2>

<h4>Designated Australian</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://twitter.com/mticehlnicohsln'>@mticehlnicohsln on Twitter</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Mitch is Reevoo's copywriter and is responsible for such office initiatives as the Jamón Leg Syndicate, "New Year's Resolution trading", a collaborative list of things that are corporate, australian accents and much more. The human resources department has nicknamed him "Vitamin M" because of the emotional nourishment he provides for his colleagues. He's also extremely humble.</p>

<p>Mitch used to write ads in Australia before moving to London for basically no reason a few years ago. In his spare time he enjoys writing for Reevoo's products and marketing.</p>

<hr />

<img class='profile-pic' src='/images/profiles/naomi.jpg' />
<h2>Naomi Morton</h2>

<h4>Wiki Artist</h4>

<p>Naomi started out studying Computer Science and Drama. She tried out being a developer but doesn't have the patience or skill, so she moved into Product Management.</p>

<p>Naomi thinks in slides, has no memory and will have a list for absolutely everything. She can usually be found scrawling horrible indecipherable drawings on notepads.</p>

<p>Outside of work she'll be found dancing, climbing or planning a trip.</p>

<hr />

<img class='profile-pic' src='/images/profiles/richard.jpg' />
<h2>Richard Batty</h2>

<p>Richard objects to the enforced 3rd person in these profiles, it's too corporate.</p>

<p>He's been a developer for a couple of years and enjoys it mainly for the chance to learn new ways of thinking. Before programming he was on the founding team of <a href='https://80000hours.org/'>80,000 Hours</a>, a non-profit that advises people on how to have more social impact with their careers. He cares a lot about creating a culture where people are inspired to develop their skills and to use them to help others.</p>

<p>Outside of work he's involved with <a href='http://www.effectivealtruism.org/about-ea'>effective altruism</a> - a community of people who use evidence and reason to try to do as much good as possible. He also enjoys bouldering, learning, and trying to find interesting music.</p>

<h2>Victor Vila</h2>

<h4>Señor Frontend Developer</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://uk.linkedin.com/in/victorvilaases'>Victor on LinkedIn</a></li>
  <li><a href='https://twitter.com/irikuo'>@irikuo on Twitter</a></li>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/irikuo'>irikuo on Github</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Victor is usually trying to convince his colleagues that JavaScript and frontend stuff is "not that bad". Sometimes he even tries to convince himself (and he has almost succeeded). He spent most of his career in web development, but for some years he had to survive in the wild land of startups, where he learned to fight any kind of animal.</p>

<p>When he is not working you can find him watching football or in the cinema. He also reads. A lot. About stuff. Any stuff. Random stuff. Not important stuff.</p>
