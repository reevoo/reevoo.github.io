<h1 id="reevoo-engineering">Reevoo Engineering</h1>

<p>We are engineers, designers and product managers who want to make the best stuff.</p>

<p>How do we work? That changes every day. You could call it agile, if you want to label it.</p>

<p>We ship a few times a day, using AWS, Capistrano, Chef, ...</p>

<p>We use <a href='https://github.com/reevoo'>Github</a> beacuse it's awesome. We use Pull Requests, because we all make mistakes. We write code in the language that fits the problem best. We write Ruby, Javascript, Java, PHP, C#, Go, Rust, Elixir, Clojure, ...</p>

<p>Oh, and we have scooters. Yes, <i>scooters</i>.</p>
